    CLOSED: [2017-12-18 Mon 01:13]
    - CLOSING NOTE [2017-12-18 Mon 01:13] \\
      added games, tested for 100 counts each
      The problem is no location is there in twitter for tweets
      the solution for that is the timezone
    entire sports will be steel blue
	1. Chess <brown>
	2. hockey
	3. Tennis <browinsh red>
	4. Cricket <green>
	5. Badminton
	6. Athletics <yellow>
	7. soccer <red>
	8. volleyball <grey>
	9. baskeyball
	10. swimming <blue>
**** TODO first for starters let us define the sports in a list
           then put a tweet count of say 15000 -  the locations
	   loop over through every sport
	   The location should be appended to the main sports list
*** TODO find out how to use d3 and add maps functionality
*** TODO change the twitter scraper to extract only location and number
*** TODO store tweets in a csv file
    Rather than showing the number of tweets, show the location where most tweets are from
    The page contains buttons and whenever we click on one sport tweets density of the particular sport shows up
*** TODO store the file in database
*** TODO start a django application
